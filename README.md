# Pandas Profiling Examples
1. Staging (retrive datasets from source and store them in a stable and protected storage)
2. Loading (Load datasets into a data warehouse with minimal cleansing to retain the provenance and authenticity of the data)
3. Documenting (generate documentation on the data schema and data quality including summary statistics and missing values)
4. Exploration (Explore the datasets in the data warehouse for understanding and quality assessment
5. Transformation (Transform the datasets for specific purpose including support of data analytics, visualization, dashboarding, and machine learning effort.

Documentation can be done using SchemaSpy to generate information about the schema (tables, columns, relationships, etc.) and Pandas Profiling to generate summary statistics.
